# Contributing :handshake:

Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to this repo! It's people like you that make it such a great learning resource.

Following are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs :bug:

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please create a new issue in the repository. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements :bulb:

If you have any ideas on how to improve the repository or add new Algorithm implementation, please create a new issue. Include labels such as `enhancement` or `new-algo` to help us categorize your suggestions.

### Your First Code Contribution :computer:

Unsure where to begin contributing to Algos? You can start by looking through the `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

- `good-first-issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- `help-wanted` - issues which are a bit more involved than `good-first-issue`.

### Pull Requests :arrow_heading_down:

The process for submitting pull requests is as follows:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages :pencil2:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### C Styleguide :art:

All C must adhere to [C Best Practices](https://www.codingunit.com/c-tutorial-coding-standards-and-practices).

## Thank You!

Again, thank you for your contributions. You make Algos a great place to learn and grow as a developer.
