# Learn C and Algorithms with Algos :books:

Welcome to Algos, your one-stop shop for learning C and algorithms! This guide will help you navigate the treasure trove of information in this repository and make the most of your learning journey.

## Getting Started with C :rocket:

If you're new to C, here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/): A free interactive C tutorial for people who want to learn C, fast.
- [C Programming at LearnVern](https://www.learnvern.com/c-programming-tutorial): A free course in Hindi (Don't as me why :)
- [C Programming For Beginners - Master the C Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/): A paid course on Udemy.

Once you've got the basics down, you can start exploring the C algorithms in this repository.

## Understanding Algorithms :bulb:

Algorithms are a crucial part of computer science and programming. Here are some resources to help you understand what algorithms are and how they work:

- [Khan Academy: Algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms): A comprehensive course on algorithms.
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844): A classic book on algorithms.

## Using This Repository :computer:

This repository is organized into different sections based on the type of algorithm. Each algorithm has its own directory with a C file and a README that explains how the algorithm works.

To run an algorithm:

1. Navigate to the directory of the algorithm: `cd directory-name`
2. Compile the C file: `gcc filename.c -o outputfile`
3. Run the compiled file: `./outputfile`

## Contributing :handshake:

Contributions are always welcome! If you've learned a new algorithm and want to add it to this repository, please refer to our [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to contribute.

Happy learning, folks!
